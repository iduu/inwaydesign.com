        <h2>eDaijia</h2>
        <p>eDaijia is the national leading online driver agency. We took insights from the ground by interview and investigate users, drivers and other stakeholders, and by data-mining from eDaijia operation and social media.

        <h2>Meican</h2>
        <p>Meican.com is a fast-evolving online food-ordering platform. Instead of from online, we started from offline, the part most complicated and also with the biggest improving potential of its new business. We redesigned the service environment and process on all client, restaurant and Meican sides, the coding system, and the physical equipment. As a result, its business efficiency increased multiple times with a cost drop, besides its remarkable user experience improvement.</p>

        <h2>LightInTheBox</h2>
        <p>LightInTheBox (LITB) is a global online shopping center. Serving for its emphasis on mobile internet before its IPO in NASDAQ 2013, we started to redesign its app. We didn’t only analyze the problems its product faced on the architecture, categories, interaction, visual and branding, but also studied user behaviors, culture phenomenon and competition in the western countries. The redesigned app achieves 3x download and 2x trading in the first month of release.Further more, we also give suggestions on how LightInTheBox can expand their business through new product creation.</p>
